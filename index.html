<h1>Towards Interactive Data Visualization Management Systems</h1>


<p>
Interactive visualizations are a powerful way to explore and draw
insights from data. As the data available to practitioners continues
to grow in complexity and size, existing systems find it harder and
harder to maintain a highly interactive experience. The goal of
this project is to develop an interactive visual data exploration
system designed and optimized to take human perception into account.
The aim of this research is to model human perception as perceptual
functions. These functions help the system avoid unnecessarily
computing visualization results that are more accurate than what
can be perceived by the end user. By developing and using these
functions, the system can provide highly accurate yet interactive
visualizations for large datasets in domains such as business
intelligence, data-driven sciences, and healthcare analytics.  
</p>

<p>
A commonly overlooked element of interactive visualization systems
is the human in the loop. Although data sizes and computational
capabilities have dramatically increased over time, human perceptual
limits have remained relatively constant. Although previous works
have used perceptual insights to justify approximation
algorithms, our goal is to build a multi-layered data analysis
system that unifies interactive visualization clients with backend
data management systems, and explicitly takes human perceptual
models into account. These models can be used to develop
perceptually-aware optimizations such as 1) automatically approximate
data transformations that are perceptually indistinguishable, 2)
model queries generated by an interaction (e.g., dragging a scrollbar
to the right) as a single session and optimize across the entire
set of queries, and 3) apply interaction-oriented caching and rewrite
strategies to minimize latency. Ultimately, these techniques can
ensure high frame-rate interactions for data exploration without
negatively impacting the insights that users draw from their
visualizations.
